
He was too hard and cold to offer much in that way, but he spoke the truth softly and then kissed her hungrily.
He jerked the robe from her hand and pulled her close in an intimate embrace, forcing his lips down on hers hungrily.
It all appeared innocent until her feet touched the ground, and then he pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her as his lips sought hers hungrily.
Her soft, forlorn words sounded like a farewell.  "This is killing me," he muttered.  He strode to her, wrapped his arms around her, and kissed her.  She yielded more easily in the dream than she ever had in real life.  Her soft, warm lips welcomed him hungrily, and he lost himself in her sweet musk, warm skin and honeyed taste.  He didn't want to leave; he wanted to spend the rest of his life making love to her on the beach.  He wanted to feel his skin pressed against hers and for her to run her fingers through his hair before scraping her nails down his back.  He wanted to take her every way he could imagine, until they lay spent and panting on the beach, until nothing but their entwined bodies and souls remained of their world.
He eased into her body at first then made love to her hungrily, relentlessly pushing her deeper into the haze of pleasure and desire, until she arched beneath him, her body on the verge of shattering.
Deidre took his face in her hands, hungrily trying to taste more of him as she explored his mouth with fervor.
